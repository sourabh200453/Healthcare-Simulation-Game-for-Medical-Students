## Project Description
The Healthcare Simulation Game is a blockchain-based platform designed to help medical students improve their knowledge through interactive simulation quizzes. The platform rewards students with tokens (points) based on their quiz performance, which can be tracked on the blockchain. This decentralized approach allows for transparent progress tracking and offers an engaging way to practice medical concepts.

The smart contract-based game ensures that each quiz is immutable, and students' progress is stored securely on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Vision
The vision behind this project is to create a gamified educational platform for medical students that combines blockchain technology with healthcare learning. By using smart contracts, we aim to provide students with a secure, transparent, and incentivized environment to enhance their medical knowledge through simulation games.



## Key Features

### 1. **Enrollment System**
- Players (students) can enroll in the game and start participating in quizzes.

### 2. **Interactive Quizzes**
- The game provides medical quizzes covering a variety of topics relevant to medical students. Each quiz consists of a question, possible answers, and a reward (in tokens) for correct answers.

### 3. **Rewards System**
- Players are rewarded with tokens for answering quizzes correctly. These tokens are tracked in the blockchain and contribute to their overall score.

### 4. **Decentralized Tracking**
- Player scores and quiz completions are stored on the blockchain, providing transparency and verifiability.

### 5. **Admin Dashboard**
- The owner (admin) can add new quizzes to the platform, enabling the continual expansion of educational content.

### 6. **Quiz Detail Transparency**
- Students can view quiz details and verify correct answers through the smart contract.
